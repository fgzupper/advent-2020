# advent_2020

My solutions for [advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/).
Starting with Clojure because Clojure is cool.
(But we may go with Go later.)

## Prerequisites

You will either need [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) 2.0.0+ or the
[Clojure CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) installed.

## Usage

With lein:
```sh
  lein run -m advent-2020.day-01
```
With clj:
```sh
  clj -m advent-2020.day-01
```
(For later days, increment the day number.)
